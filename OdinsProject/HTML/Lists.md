# Lists | Notes

These notes summarize the "Lists" lesson from The Odin Project, explaining how to create and use different types of lists in HTML.

## 📜 Overview

Lists are commonly used on the web to organize items, whether it's a shopping list, a recipe, or a top 10 list. HTML provides two primary types of lists: **unordered lists** and **ordered lists**.

## 🖋️ HTML List Types

### 1. **Unordered Lists**

- Use the `<ul>` element to create unordered lists.
- Each item in the list is wrapped in a `<li>` (list item) element.
- Unordered lists are displayed with bullet points.
- **Example**:
  ```html
  <ul>
    <li>Milk</li>
    <li>Eggs</li>
    <li>Bread</li>
  </ul>
  ```

### 2. **Ordered Lists**

- Use the `<ol>` element to create ordered lists.
- Each item is wrapped in a `<li>` element.
- Ordered lists are displayed with numbers or letters.
- **Example**:
  ```html
  <ol>
    <li>Step 1: Preheat oven.</li>
    <li>Step 2: Mix ingredients.</li>
    <li>Step 3: Bake.</li>
  </ol>
  ```

## 🛠️ Practical Applications

- **Unordered Lists**:  
  Useful when the order of items doesn’t matter, such as:

  - Shopping lists
  - Lists of favorite foods or places

- **Ordered Lists**:  
  Useful when the order is important, such as:
  - Step-by-step instructions
  - Ranked lists (e.g., top 5 movies)

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

1. **Unordered Lists**: Created with `<ul>`; items displayed with bullet points.
2. **Ordered Lists**: Created with `<ol>`; items displayed with numbers.
3. **List Items**: Use `<li>` to define individual items in both `<ul>` and `<ol>`.
